# Full API Testing Plan - COMPLETED

## Current Status
- Existing test files: test_general_api.py, test_task_api.py, test_personality_api.py, test_community_api.py
- Added test files: test_safety_api.py, test_chat_api.py
- Routes registered: personality, task, community, safety, chat
- Health and info endpoints tested in general tests

## Steps Completed
- [x] Run existing tests to verify current functionality (23 tests passed)
- [x] Create test_safety_api.py for safety routes (/api/safety/risk-event)
- [x] Create test_chat_api.py for chat routes (/api/chat/chat)
- [x] Run all tests with coverage report (32 tests passed)
- [x] Verify all endpoints are tested
- [x] Provide final test summary and coverage report

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 32
- **Passed**: 32
- **Failed**: 0
- **Coverage**: 66% overall
- **Test Execution Time**: ~1.4 seconds

## Coverage Details
- **High Coverage**: test files (95-100%), models (67-100%)
- **Medium Coverage**: routes (67-87%), services (47-70%)
- **Low Coverage**: app.py (45%), chat/game models (0%)
- **HTML Report**: Generated in htmlcov/ directory

## Recommendations
